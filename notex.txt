- SASS vs SCSS
The only difference is syntax.
With SASS indentation is key!

- Inheritance can be achieved through properties and selectors

- Mixins in SASS take a functional approach to generate content

- Import in SASS has many benefits over traditional imports in CSS.

- Prefixing a file with a underscore _ implies that those files are 'partials' to be shared/used by SCSS files and
not to be compiled directly to CSS

- WATCH whole directory on 'import'
sass --watch SASS_Import:CSS --style expanded --sourcemap=none

- Maps allows for a complex array of data to be grouped together

- source-map files tells the browser what location to point. With it browser will point to scss without it will point to css
